# MLP-experiments
Here there is my workbench to experiment on how to make the MLP efficient 


First file is made to finding the best hyper-parameter configuration.

Second file is by using the last optimizer (GrokFast) - https://arxiv.org/html/2405.20233v2. 

I took expiration from lucidrains and bycloud (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvb_4Jj5kBo).
 
The implementation is working as you can see:

I will be looking at the best hyper-parameter configuration since I'm benchmarking with the other configuration by relying to adam, sgd, rmsprop.
